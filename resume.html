            A lifetime of love with code, then an amazing experience in the military as an Air Traffic Controller,
            enjoying its "life-and-death"
            requirement for both problem-solving and staying on top, helped flame my passion to learn how to code and
            gain a deeper understanding of
            software development. Ever enthusiastic to leverage my technical and problem-solving skills to develop
            software solutions that are functional and useful.
